Spam mail Prediction
Introduction
The goal of this project is to create an efficient spam filter using machine learning algorithms. By preprocessing the email text and applying feature extraction techniques, we can train models to accurately detect spam emails.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing email text.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Implementing Logistic Regression for classification.
Model Evaluation: Measuring performance with accuracy.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
